# A First example

## Theory
Start with your first optimization example. If you are the first of FEniCS computing, please see the [tutorial of the FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/documentation/).
This example is based on the dolfin-adjoint's documentation. Please also see [this page](http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/documentation/poisson-topology/poisson-topology.html).

Here, we are concerned about minimizing the following compliance:

$$
\int_\Omega fT\,dx
$$
