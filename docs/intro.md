# Introduction

Pytop is a powerful tool designed to extend the capabilities of FEniCS for topology optimization. It provides robust tools for advanced computational design and supports multiphysics simulations. Pytop is fully compatible with MPI, allowing for efficient monitoring of parallel applications.

## General Optimization Form in Software

This software scopes following general optimization form:
$$
\min_{\bm d} F(\bm d, \bm u) = \int_\Omega f(\bm d, \bm u) \ dV
$$
$$
G_j(\bm d, \bm u) \leq 0
$$
where $\Omega$ is the design domain and $\bm u$ represents specific fields that satisfy governing equations for any physics defined in $\Omega$. For example, $\bm u$ is the displacement vector in an elastic deformation problem. $F$ is the functional that represents the objective of the optimization. $\bm d$ is the design vector, and $G_j$ are the functionals representing the constraints.

## Container

We provide a container for this repository. The container includes python 3.11, FEniCS bundles, and NLOpt with python interface.
The container is avaiable in [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ichiharanaruki/pytop/general).
To try out this repository, connect to the codespace with the following:

## Installation

To install Pytop, you need to have Python and FEniCS installed on your system. You can install Pytop via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Naruki-Ichihara/pytop.git@main
```

## Basic usage
### Import pytop
First, you need to import *pytop* by standard Python style:
```python
import pytop as pt
```
In the header of pytop, all methods and classes of FEniCS will be imported if FEniCS was collectively installed. So, all methods in FEniCS can be called directly like:
```python
...
U = pt.FunctionSoace(mesh, "CG", 1)
u = pt.Function(U)
...
```
Please refer to the [FEniCS document](https://fenicsproject.org/) to use fundamental functions in FEniCS.
### Mesh
Second, you need to generate (or import) mesh. This software provides easy method to import external mesh, `import_external_mesh`. This method use `meshio` in the backgroud, so any mesh type that supported by [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) is supported.
```python
mesh = pt.import_external_mesh(path_to_the_meshfile)
```
Of course, you can generate mesh by built-in mesh generator in FEniCS like as:
```python
NUMBER_OF_NODES = (100, 100)
POSITION = (100, 100)
mesh = pt.RectangleMesh(pt Point(0, 0), pt.Point(*POSITION), *NUMBER_OF_NODES)
```
Moreover, we provide simple interface of [pygmsh](https://github.com/nschloe/pygmsh). pygmsh can generate more flexible geometry, whether 2D or 3D.
```python
import pytop as pt
import pygmsh

...
mesh = pt.from_pygmsh(pyg_mesh)
```

### Function space and Function
This is standard procedure in the FEniCS. You first need to define `FunctionSpace` and then `Function` (If need, `TrialFunction` and `TestFunction`).
```python
U = pt.VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', 1) #1st order continuous Galerkin vector space
uh = pf.Function(U, name='displacement)
u = pt.TrialFunction(U)
du = pt.TestFunction(U)
```

### Boundary Condition
This is also standard procedure in the FEniCS. To define sub-domain of mesh, `pt.SubDomain` class is useful.
```python
class Left(pt.SubDomain):
    def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
        return x[0] < 1e-6 and on_boundary

bc = pt.DirichletBC(U, pt.Constant((0, 0)), Left())
```
This restricts the left side boundary (x[0] < 1e-6) zero displacement.
To apply Noiman boundary condition, you can use useful method `make_noiman_boundary_domains`.
```python
class Loading(pt.SubDomain):
    def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
        reurn x[0] > 200-1e-6 and 45.0 < x[1] < 55.0 and on_boundary
    
ds = pt.make_noiman_boundary_domains(mesh, [Loading()], True)
```
This function returns `Measure` class, `ds`.

### Design variable
You need to define design variable before optimization. The `DesignVariables` class can store multiple design variables with their function space, name, initial value, range, pre/post process, recording path, and recording parameter.
```python
X = pt.FunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', 1)
design_variables = pt.DesignVariables()
design_variables.register(X,
                          "parameter_name",
                          [initial value],
                          [range],
                          lambda x: some pre process,
                          lambda x: some post process,
                          "recording_path",
                          recording_interval)
```
### Problem definition
The problem statement can be constructed with `ProblemStatement`.
```python
# pytop.physics module includes useful utilities to define physics.
from pytop.physics import elasticity as el

class Elasticity_Problem(pt.ProblemStatement):
  # objective is abstruct method that must be defined.
ã€€# In this, you need to define physics problem and return evaluation value.
    def objective(self, design_variables): 
        self.rho = design_variables["density"] # You need to access design variables through design_variables.
        a = el.linear_2D_elasticity_bilinear_form(u, du, E, nu, penalized_weight(self.rho, eps=1e-4)) # Bilinear form for 2D elastic problem
        L = pt.inner(f, du) * ds(1)  # ds(1) means first subdomain that defined by make_noiman_boundary_domains method.
        pt.solve(a == L, uh, bc)
        return pt.assemble(pt.inner(f, uh) * ds(1))
    # methods that start with "constraint_" is inequality constraint (x<=0).
    def constraint_volume(self, design_variables):
        unitary = pt.project(pt.Constant(1), X)
        return pt.assemble(self.rho*pt.dx)/pt.assemble(unitary*pt.dx) - TARGET_DENSITY
```

### Optimizer
`NloptOptimizer` will construct NLopt `opt` class with `DesignVariables` and `ProblemStatement`. 
```python
opt = pt.NloptOptimizer(design_variables, Problem(), "LD_MMA")
# LD_MMA means Method of moving asymptotes.
```
Then you set parameter of optimizer by nlopt optimizer class methods.
Please refer avaiable method in [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Python_Reference/).
For example, here we set to maximum iteration number is 300, and relative tolerance is 1e-4:
```python
opt.set_maxeval(300)
opt.set_ftol_rel(1e-4)
```
Then optimization will start by calling `run` method.
```python
opt.run(path_for_data_logging)
```
## Tips
### MPI parallelization
This software is designed as parallelization-ready. Problem is automatically divided into partial problems and computed in each cpus. We provide useful detaclass for MPI, `MPI_Communicator`. You can construct a mpi group use this class,
```python
import pytop as pt
comm_group = pt.MPI_Communicator.comm_world
```
Single problem must be in the same group. Then,`mpirun` executes the solving with cpus you mentioned:
```bash
mpirun -n 36 python your_problem.py
```
In the container, you need to give option to allow run as a root user:
```bash
mpirun -n 36 --allow-run-as-root python your_problem.py
```
Above example use 36 cpus. 

### Working with pygmsh
You can use ```pygmsh``` as mesh generator.
Documentation of ```pygmsh``` is available [here](https://pygmsh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
```python
import pytop as pt
import pygmsh

with pygmsh.geo.Geometry() as geom:
    lcar = 0.1
    p1 = geom.add_point([0.0, 0.0], lcar)
    p2 = geom.add_point([1.0, 0.0], lcar)
    p3 = geom.add_point([1.0, 0.5], lcar)
    p4 = geom.add_point([1.0, 1.0], lcar)
    s1 = geom.add_bspline([p1, p2, p3, p4])

    p2 = geom.add_point([0.0, 1.0], lcar)
    p3 = geom.add_point([0.5, 1.0], lcar)
    s2 = geom.add_spline([p4, p3, p2, p1])

    ll = geom.add_curve_loop([s1, s2])
    pl = geom.add_plane_surface(ll)

    mesh = geom.generate_mesh()

mesh = pt.from_pygmsh(mesh)
```

Use ```planation``` option is used, all ```z``` coordinates will be neglected.
```python
mesh = pt.from_pygmsh(mesh, planation=True)
```
